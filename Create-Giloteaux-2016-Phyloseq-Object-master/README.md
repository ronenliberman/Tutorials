# Create-Giloteaux-2016-Phyloseq-Object
Files and script used to generate Giloteaux (Microbiome 2016) phyloseq object for the Introduction to Metagenomics Summer Workshop 2019 data analysis session. 


Metadata, OTU table and taxonomy files obtained from the QIIME2 tutorial [Differential abundance analysis with gneiss](https://docs.qiime2.org/2019.4/tutorials/gneiss/) (accessed on 06/13/2019).

Data used in the tutorial are from Giloteaux et. al. [Reduced diversity and altered composition of the gut microbiome in individuals with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome](https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-016-0171-4) published in Microbiome (2016).

Jordan Bisanz's [qiime2R package](https://rdrr.io/github/jbisanz/qiime2R/f/README.md) was used to convert the QIIME2 artifacts into a phyloseq object.
